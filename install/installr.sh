# installo.sh
# A script to (optionally) erase a volume and install macos and
# additional packagesfound in a packages folder in the same directory
# as this script
#
# Modified from munki's installr tool and Rich Trouton's First_Boot_Package_Install_Generator tool. All
# glory to those fine projects.
#
# Installr combines the above, rather than install/running pkgs/scripts from the recovery environment,
# we place the mechanism from First_Boot_Package to the new disk and drops your payload of items off 
# for it, eliminating the headaches of trying to install things from the gimped Recovery environment. 
# Other Changes include baking an OS install app (of your choosing) into the DMG so we can upgrade as 
# part of the (optional) nuke and pave step.
